## State technology highlights: the API you use, what you store in your database, anything cool, hot, challenging, or annoying/frustrating
- **API:** [Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/)
- **Storage:** In our database, we store the breweries that users favorite and their log-in credentials.
- **Anthing cool:** We base the list of returned breweries from our API on user location in terms of latitude and longitude
- **Annoying/Frustrating:** Necessity of Keck lab access for building app. There was a number of issues we ran into here with needing Keck admin access in order to import packages and build the app. Complicated things to make us have to send files over email to see if app will correctly build. 

## List any acknowledgements/thanks/credits
