# about.md—Final Presentation/Description of Your Mobile App
## Provide a title for your overall project (it doesn’t have to be the app’s name, but it should certainly describe it)
*BrewBuddy*

## List your team and supply your general roles
- Aaron Masek
- Henry Benso

## Explain your user audience and their needs
The target audience of our app are 21+-year-olds looking for the nearest place to drink a beer and grab a bite. From there, a user is able to favorite this brewery to their account for future reference.

## Show screenshots of your app (during the presentation, this should be live/video)


## State technology highlights: the API you use, what you store in your database, anything cool, hot, challenging, or annoying/frustrating
- **API:** [Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/)
- **Storage:** In out database, we store the breweries that users favorite and their log-in credentials.
- **Anthing cool:** We base the list of returned breweries from our API on user location in terms of latitude and longitude
- **Annoying/Frustrating:** Necessity of Keck lab access for building app. There was a number of issues we ran into here with needing Keck admin access in order to import packages and build the app. Complicated things to make us have to send files over email to see if app will correctly build. 

## List any acknowledgements/thanks/credits
